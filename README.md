Homebank CSV Converter
======================
This converter will convert a CSV file, that was downloaded from the [DKB webinterface](https://www.dkb.de/banking) into the CSV format used by [Homebank](http://homebank.free.fr/).

This is probably far from perfect, but I used it as a small project to learn some Go. So if you see room for improvement, feel free to create an issue or even a PR.
